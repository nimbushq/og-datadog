Please Help
-----------

If you’ve found this guide useful, please see if you can help (in increasing levels of commitment and expertise):

-	**Focused pull requests:** [Pull requests](https://github.com/nimbushq/og-datadog/pulls) with focused changes like typos, specific tips, and corrections are always welcome and fast to review and merge in. Keep them small and focused, and *use multiple PRs for unrelated changes*. (See [writing conventions](#writing-conventions) below.)
-	**Track issues:** [File issues](https://github.com/nimbushq/og-datadog/issues) to aggregate ideas or links if it’s clear something needs to be improved, but it’s not possible to file a PR immediately.

Review Process
--------------

### Pull Request Etiquette

-	Keep changes as small as is practical. Do not make changes to multiple sections at once, alter whitespace in broad ways, etc.
-	**Neutrality:** If you have an affiliation related to what you are changing, please mention it.
-	Please do your best to review current issues and pull requests to avoid duplication.

### Writing Style

-	**Link to references:** If you are adding an item, whenever possible, try to add a link or reference to relevant discussion or reference pages.
-	**Be brief:** Avoid long expository paragraphs; it’s better to link to a blog. (We are open to linking to your own blog, if it’s the best source.)
-	**Include opinions and common practice:** Thoughtful opinion is helpful. If there are multiple conventions or ideas on something held by experts, mention the different ones.
-	**Clarity:** Strive for consistency with conventions listed here, but clarity is most important.

### Pull Request Review

When creating a PR or reviewing one, it’s helpful to consider a few questions:

1.	Are relevant docs linked (Datadog and third party blogs)?
2.	Can more details be added without lengthening it significantly?
3.	Can the same information be conveyed with more succinctly or more clearly?
4.	Copy editing: Does it match the [writing style](#writing-style) and [conventions](#writing-conventions) (including emoji symbols, punctuation, and grammar)?
5.	Are there any other parts of the guide that should be updated at the same time? (Examples are adding new sections to the table of contents, adding new internal links, rows to tables, etc.)
6.	Are there additional improvements that should be filed as issues?


Writing Conventions
-------------------

To keep a polished, consistent style we list a bunch of our conventions. Try to follow these and/or enforce them in reviews:

-	Terms that appear for the first time in **boldface** are defined there in a brief summary, with a link if possible to what is probably the best page for that concept. It’s also fine to boldface **key statements** that guide the eye.
-	**Boldfaced headings:** When possible and appropriate, begin bulleted items with a boldfaced summary, as illustrated here. This helps the reader skim the contents.
-	**Links:**
	-	Related content that elaborates or gives more detail is included via standard inline hyperlinks within the text.
	-	References or citations backing some info that is already explained in the text is in [brackets] at the end of the item (with link for web pages, no link for books).
-	**Emoji icons:** These icons aid readability; use them whenever appropriate (usually at the start of bulleted items), as listed in the [**legend**](https://github.com/nimbushq/og-datadog#legend).
-	**Typographical conventions:**
	-	Use Unicode open and close quotes “like this” and not "like this".
	-	Use oriented apostrophes (Unicode’s, not ASCII's).
	-	Use em dashes — like this (not two hyphens -- like this).
-	**Section conventions:** When appropriate please add sections covering these items (where *X* = EC2, S3, etc.):
	-	*X Basics*: The elementary facts you should know if you don’t yet know anything about the service.
	-	*X Tips*: Everything you should know about the service, from big stuff to details.
	-	*X Gotchas*: Common problems, large and small, as well as misconceptions and quirks.
	-	Not all sections need to follow the above conventions exactly.
	-	Note we try to make sections uniquely titled, so GitHub links to Markdown section anchors don’t collide and are stable.
